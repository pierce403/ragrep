# Core runtime dependencies are intentionally minimal to keep installation fast
# and compatible with all supported Python versions. Optional integrations such
# as ChromaDB or Hugging Face transformers can be installed via extras declared
# in ``pyproject.toml`` (e.g. ``pip install ragrep[full]``).
