# Core runtime dependencies are intentionally minimal to keep installation fast
# and compatible with supported Python versions (3.9+). Optional integrations
# such as ChromaDB (ragrep[retrieval]) or Hugging Face transformers
# (ragrep[generation]) can be installed via extras declared in ``pyproject.toml``,
# for example: ``pip install ragrep[full]``.
