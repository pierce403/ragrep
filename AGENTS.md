This file serves as a knowledge base for insights, learnings, and discoveries made during the development of the RAG tool.

## RAG Fundamentals

### What is RAG?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines the power of retrieval systems with generative AI models. It works by:
1. **Retrieval**: Finding relevant documents or information from a knowledge base
2. **Augmentation**: Using retrieved information to provide context
3. **Generation**: Producing responses based on both the query and retrieved context

### Key Components
- **Retrieval System**: Searches and retrieves relevant documents
- **Vector Database**: Stores embeddings for semantic search
- **Language Model**: Generates responses based on retrieved context
- **Embedding Model**: Converts text to vector representations

## Research Findings

### Recent Developments
- Advanced retrieval techniques beyond simple vector similarity
- Hybrid search combining dense and sparse retrieval
- Multi-modal RAG for handling different content types
- Real-time knowledge updates and dynamic retrieval

### Performance Considerations
- Retrieval accuracy vs. generation quality trade-offs
- Latency optimization for real-time applications
- Scalability challenges with large knowledge bases
- Cost optimization for API usage

## Implementation Insights

### Technical Challenges
- Document preprocessing and chunking strategies
- Embedding model selection and fine-tuning
- Context window management
- Hallucination prevention

### Best Practices
- Use appropriate chunk sizes for different content types
- Implement re-ranking for better retrieval quality
- Add source attribution and confidence scoring
- Monitor and evaluate system performance
